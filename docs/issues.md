- lsp server: unnecessary session state, after any run, just ask porridge for diags and broadcast to all files with a "durable" lifetime (open in lsp), needs durability system.
- Source durability, if open for analysis only, consume at "parse" time, if open through lsp, only materialize at parse time, but keep rope in memory.

# Design question

- DefDecl: is this the correct abstraction, what is DefDecl vs the Ast, isn't lowering supposed to generate Ast nodes? These separations seems completely backwards/redundant? DefKind is just a flat enum, where is the rest of the data etc?
- Are the stage traits (LowerStage, HoverStage etc) even necessary anymore when we have systems and plugins?

# Tracked follow-ups

- Imported-query collisions are not diagnosed: `check_import_collisions`
  covers fragments only, so a local query colliding with an imported query
  (or two imports providing the same query name) passes the language
  checks and only surfaces as a generate-boundary artifact collision.
- Artifact paths are flat per kind; docs/spec/resolution-scopes.md calls
  for scope-qualified artifact groups, which will let independent scopes
  keep identical operation names without generate-boundary collisions.
